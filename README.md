MyReads: A Book Tracking App
============================

## Udacity React nanodegree

  Dario Varotto - Jul 2017 cohort

The first project for the [Udacity React nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/degrees/react-nanodegree--nd019):
an application to create a bookshelf to select and categorize books.

It allows to search, consuming a Node API via React and organize the books
practicing the React fundamentals.

We start from a [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/),
a client API, and some template code from [the starter project](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) and we
add the React functionalities.
